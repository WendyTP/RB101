['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

=begin
The above code should return an integer of 11
The Array#pop method removes the last item in an array, and returns it.
Since the returned item is a string ("caterpillar"), the .size method can be applied to the string.
The size method then returns an integer of the length of this string.

=end
